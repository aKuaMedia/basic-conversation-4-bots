# basic-conversation-4-bots
Training sets for different chatbots in basic conversations

The purpose of this repository is to have a reusable baseline of basic conversations necessary for any chatbot.
The main basic conversations that we must cover are:

- Greetings and farewells.
- Presentations.
- Give basic "personal" information
- Date and time information


On a second scale, we can approach training for more specific but equally generalist conversations:

- Weather Information
- Address search
- Other ...

The project must have the necessary automation scripts to build the import files in the main chatbox frameworks ([wit.ai](https://wit.ai/), [api.ai](https://api.ai/), [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai/), [Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) ...)

In addition, given the specific language specifics, each base file will be repeated for each language, so that different import files can be generated in the frameworks for each language.
